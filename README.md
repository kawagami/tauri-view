# TauriView

📷 A lightweight, high-performance image viewer built with **Rust** and **Tauri**.  
Supports reading images directly from folders and ZIP archives — fast and responsive.

## ✨ Project Purpose

This project was created to solve a specific pain point:  
🧨 **Honeyview lags when opening large ZIP files containing many images.**

To address this, `TauriView` uses the speed and concurrency features of **Rust**, combined with **Tauri**'s cross-platform UI capabilities, to build a smoother, more efficient image viewer.

## 🔧 Features (Planned or WIP)

- 📂 Read and browse multiple images from a **local folder**
- 🗜️ Extract and view images directly from a **ZIP archive** (without unpacking manually)
- 🚀 Optimized for speed and minimal memory footprint
- 🖥️ Lightweight cross-platform GUI using **Tauri**
- 🔄 Fast navigation between images (keyboard/mouse support)
- 🧠 Smart preloading for smoother experience with large image sets
